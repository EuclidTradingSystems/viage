The tests here are modified version of the test within Qt.

The branch `tests_from_qt` contains the tests from Qt as is and is updated
and merged into master.

Here is the method used to update the tests:

```
 export QTBASE=~/path/to/qt/sources/qtbase

 git checkout tests_from_qt
 
 # remove the previous tests, and replace it by the newer test from Qt
 rm -r qmetamethod qmetaproperty qmetaobject qobject qmetaenum
 cp -r $QTBASE/tests/auto/corelib/kernel/qmetamethod .
 cp -r $QTBASE/tests/auto/corelib/kernel/qmetaproperty .
 cp -r $QTBASE/tests/auto/corelib/kernel/qmetaobject .
 cp -r $QTBASE/tests/auto/corelib/kernel/qobject .
 cp -r $QTBASE/tests/auto/corelib/kernel/qmetaenum .

 # check if you need to add files maybe?
 git status

 git commit -a
 
 git checkout master 
 git merge tests_from_qt
 # Fix conflicts and adapt to verdigris
```

The tests are still supposed to work with older Qt version, so tests that test Qt behavior
should be wrapped with `#if QT_VERSION >= QT_VERSION_CHECK(5, X, 0)` or be skipped
with old version
